Question 2.
Counting the pairs with k different from an integer list.
eg: list = [1, 3,5] and k = 2
expected: we will have 2 pairs: {(1,3), (3,5)}
Note: we also consider the negative numbers. You may only use Python

-----------------------------------------------------------

Here i kept two types of file
1. jupyter notebook file
2. python file

K: value and list configured in config.ini file.
We can modify list and k value to do testing....

We can open this file and directly run in any IDE for testing.

Sample output loos like:

Given Input List is: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] with difference 1 
Counting pair values are: {(1, 2), (3, 4), (2, 3), (4, 5)}, for the difference: 1 
And number of pairs is: 4
