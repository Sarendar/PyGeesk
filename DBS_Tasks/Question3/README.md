Question 3 .
Return the list of indices. The indices is a sublist points to the same person. The same persons means
they have the same name or email or phone. You may only use Python.
eg:
 data = [
 ("username1","phone_number1", "email1"),
 ("usernameX","phone_number1", "emailX"),
 ("usernameZ","phone_numberZ", "email1Z"),
 ("usernameY","phone_numberY", "emailX"),
 ]
 expected: [[0,1,3][2]]

Here i kept two types of file
1. jupyter notebook file
2. python file

To testing this script we need to change the data veriable list in python file.
After changing input list we can run this script in any IDE.


Saple output looks like:

***************************** 
 Mached inidces sublit: [0, 1, 3, 4] 
 Not mached indices sublist: [2, 5, 6]
 Expected Return list: [[0, 1, 3, 4], [2, 5, 6]]
